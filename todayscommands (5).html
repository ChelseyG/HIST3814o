<p>I am attempting to learn DHBox and get a better understanding of how the application works. I have had many fails so far with getting my documents to save, so I am hoping that by deleting my history and starting new it will work.</p>
<p>I managed to re-open the file and it was saved. I am very happy right now!</p>
